## Security Operations Center (SOC)

A _Security Operations Center_ (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events. Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:

-   Vulnerabilities
-   Policy violations
-   Unauthorized activity
-   Network intrusions

#### Threat Intelligence
_intelligence_ refers to information you gather about actual and potential enemies. 

A _threat_ is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. 

Threat intelligence aims to gather information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries.

The purpose would be to achieve a _threat-informed defense_. 


## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

#### Digital Forensics

In defensive security, the focus of digital forensics shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content. Consequently, digital forensics will focus on different areas such as:

-   File System
-   System memory
-   System logs
-   Network logs

#### Incident Response

An _incident_ usually refers to a data breach or cyber attack; however, in some cases, it can be something less critical, such as a misconfiguration, an intrusion attempt, or a policy violation. 

The aim of Incident response is to reduce damage and recover in the shortest time possible. 

The four major phases of the incident response process are:

1.  Preparation: This requires a team trained and ready to handle incidents. 
2.  Detection and Analysis: The team has the necessary resources to detect any incident; moreover, it is essential to further analyze any detected incident to learn about its severity.
3.  Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Once an incident is detected, it is crucial to stop it from affecting other systems, eliminate it, and recover the affected systems. 
4.  Post-Incident Activity

#### Malware Analysis

Malware analysis aims to learn about such malicious programs using various means:

1.  Static analysis works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. Usually, this requires solid knowledge of assembly language (processor’s instruction set, i.e., computer’s fundamental instructions).
2.  Dynamic analysis works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities. It lets you observe how the malware behaves when running.
